## General Info

Ez Healing adds a new `/heal` command in Minecraft! The command works exactly the same as the `/damage` command, except it heals targets instead of damages them. The command also has an optional `value` argument. If you don't supply that argument, the command will restore the target to full health by default.

## More Details

This mod is only intended to, obviously, work in survival mode. However, there is a bug currently where you can also heal yourself in spectator mode, so just be weary of that.

In servers, only users with a permission level of 2 are allowed to use the command. In single player, any player can use the command.

This mod is supported in versions 1.20+, as well as 1.19-1.19.4.
